# Merkle-Tree-Gift-List
The Merkel Tree Gift List project manages gift assignments based on a Merkel tree structure. Users input person and gift data and hashed into the tree. Clients provide a name and proof to the server. If the hash matches the stored Merkel root, gifts are assigned. This ensures secure and accurate gift management.
